A file for logging problems that exist at the moment.

1) I draw a line, release it, and a new one starts drawing immediately
And a new one should be drawn when I press the left button again, but it doesn't happen

2) Sometimes strange things happen when you switch between tiles, and the last point of the previous one and the first point of the current one are connected by a straight line

3) When we draw with a different color and thickness on one socket, the same is transferred to another socket
And ideally, after we have accepted a drawing on a socket, we should still maintain our state of color, line thickness, and so on.



Block for describing what needs to be done, ideas, thoughts, improvements

1) Logging service to track errors on the service and the client

2) Improve the design

3) Decomposition of the front
